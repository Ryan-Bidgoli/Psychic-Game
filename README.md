# Psychic-Game
The Psychic game takes in a letter that the user inputs and compares to see if
it's the same random letter the computer has chosen.
If they match you win the game and marks down a win, other wise if you don't get it 
in 10 guesses it reset from the beginning and marks it down as a loss
